Advent of Code 2024

To compile:
  1. run `cc -o nob nob.c`
  2. run `./nob`

Structure:
  -   `src`   folder holds each day's challenge. For day 1,
              the challenge's solution is `src/1.c`

  -   `out`   folder holds each day's compiled challenge. For day 1,
              the challenge's solution executable is `out/1`

  -  `input`  folder holds input files for some challenges. For day 1,
              the input is `input/1.txt`, which holds two sets of numbers.

  - `include` folder holds some helper headers. For example, `include/benchmark.h`,
              a header that is used for quick and simple benchmarking of code.
